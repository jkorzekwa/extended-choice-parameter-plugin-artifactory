    The multi-level property file is a tab delimited file, with levels defined in columns and choices defined in rows.  For example, to have a 2 level selection where you first select a country and then a city, you could specify a file such as the following:<br><br>
            <pre>
Country	City
United States	San Francisco
United States	Chicago
Mexico	Mexico City
Mexico	Cancun
            </pre>
    This would result in a first drop down with the options "Select a country...", "United States", and "Mexico" (the initial selection is "Select a country...", which serves as a label for the drop down).  After the user selects a country, a "City" drop down would appear.  If United States was chosen first, then San Francisco and Chicago would be options, but if Mexico was selected then instead Mexico City and Cancun would be options.
    The properties file can be placed anywhere on the file-system that Jenkins can access.
